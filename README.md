# Basilisk Documentation

A technical documentation page for a free software program for solving fluid mechanical problems named Basilisk.

This page showcases my skills to:
- Use CSS and html to display technical documentation;
- Use media query to accomodate different screen sizes;
- Use html to create an accessible webpage.

See a demo of the full page at [codepen](https://codepen.io/sd_athena/full/jemQaJ/).

This is one of the five projects that I did for the Responsive Web Design Certificate at freeCodeCamp.org : "[Build a Technical Documentation Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page)".
